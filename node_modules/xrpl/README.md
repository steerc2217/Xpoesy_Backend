# xrpl.js

This package includes the `xrpl` library. This repository uses a monorepo
layout. Please find the README for `xrpl` [here](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl.js/tree/main/README.md).

READMEs for other packages in this monorepo are located at the root of their
package, but since newcomers to XRPL are likely to want to use the `xrpl`
package this README is at the root of the project.
